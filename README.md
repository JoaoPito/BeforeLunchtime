# BeforeLunchtime
A To-do list app so that I can finish my tasks before lunchtime and stop procrastination.

The idea is that I would choose 3 or 4 things to do in the morning and use the app to keep track of the time left and what tasks I have done in that day.
It resets or deletes the tasks after each day (or some specified time) so that every day I would have something different to do.
